# Programmable control of AAV entry rewires serotype dependence for universal and low-dose genome integration
## Abstract
  This repository stores the code for the article “Programmable control of AAV entry rewires serotype dependence for universal and low-dose genome integration”, ensuring that other researchers can replicate all analyses and figures presented in the paper.  
    
  We will provide data generated in our laboratory, public datasets, and analysis scripts. This includes two sections: RNA-seq & WGS for safety assessment.  
  
  **To reproduce the code, please modify the tool and file paths in the scripts.**
## Data & Code
### Section 1: Insertion analysis of AAV-SB system (Fig.4)
  Raw sequencing and processed data are stored in HRA016166.

### Section 2: CRISPR screening for AAV.APR31 receptor (Fig.5)
Raw sequencing and processed data are stored in HRA016166. `wgs_insertion_bed_bedstat_files` is the result of quantification of insertion calculated by polydus. 
  `gene_coor_ref` is the reference of genomic features to assess safty of insertion.
